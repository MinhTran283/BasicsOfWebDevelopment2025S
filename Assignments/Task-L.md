> [!NOTE]
> The material was created with the help of ChatGPT and Copilot.

---

💡 This task brings together your previous work from:

* [**Task I: Landing page**](Task-I.md)
* [**Task J: Catalog page**](Task-J.md)
* [**Task K: Order page**](Task-K.md)

In earlier tasks you **received feedback** from the teacher and also noticed your **own mistakes or improvement ideas**.
In **Task L** you will **use that feedback** to polish your three pages into **one coherent, high-quality website**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a **unified three-page website** for your rental business by:

1. Collecting your three pages (Landing, Catalog, Order) into **one folder** (`l`) in your Git repository.
2. Ensuring the three pages form a **consistent and professional site**.
3. Improving your pages based on:

   * Teacher feedback from Tasks **I, J, and K**
   * Your **own observations** from earlier submissions
4. **Publishing the final site using GitHub Pages.**

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

You will learn to:

* Combine multiple pages into a **cohesive website**
* Apply feedback and self-reflection to improve design and usability
* Refine **navigation, responsiveness, accessibility, and validation**
* Organize project files clearly in Git
* Publish a working website using **GitHub Pages**

---

## 1️⃣ Folder & File Structure (Git)

In your course repository:

1. Create a folder named **`l`** (lowercase L).
2. Inside this folder include **three HTML files**:

   * `index.html` → **Landing page**
   * `catalog.html` (or similar) → **Catalog page**
   * `order.html` (or similar) → **Order page**
3. Make sure:

   * All internal links use **relative paths**, e.g. `href="catalog.html"`
   * CSS/JS files are correctly linked
   * Images are located and referenced correctly
4. Reuse your earlier code, but the **final improved versions must be in `l`**.

---

## 2️⃣ Use Feedback & Self-Review

Re-read the feedback you received for Tasks I, J, and K, and inspect your own earlier submissions.

Document these improvements:

* in a small `README.md` inside folder `l`, or

Example changes:

* Unified navigation bar across all pages
* Fixed contrast issues with buttons
* Improved responsiveness of catalog grid
* Added clearer form validation messages
* Replaced incorrect heading levels

---

## 3️⃣ Unified Layout & Design

Your three pages must feel like *one site*. Ensure:

### 🔗 Navigation

* Same **header**, **nav**, and **footer** on every page
* All nav links work between all pages
* (Optional) highlight the current page in the navigation

### 🎨 Visual identity

* Shared color palette
* Consistent typography, spacing, button styles
* Similar card layouts, margins, and shadows

### 📱 Responsiveness

Test the site on:

* Phones
* Tablets
* Desktop

Fix any broken elements, overflow, or layout issues.

---

## 4️⃣ HTML, Semantics & Media

**✔️ Semantics**

* Use correct semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, etc.)

---

**✔️ Validation**

* Use the W3C HTML Validator and fix errors/warnings

---

**✔️ Images & Media**

* Include the required **example.jpg** in your catalog page (can also be hidden)
* Check image alt texts and file sizes

---

**✔️ Forms**

* Improve the order form:

  * labels
  * required fields
  * clean layout

---

## 5️⃣ Publishing with GitHub Pages (Required)

You **must publish** the finished website using **GitHub Pages**:

1. Push the folder `l` with `index.html` to your course repository.
2. After deployment, provide the **public GitHub Pages URL** in your submission.

Example URL:

```
https://username.github.io/repository-name/l/
```

Your landing page must be visible at:

```
https://username.github.io/repository-name/l/index.html
```

---

## 📤 Submission

Submit in itslearning:

1. **GitHub repository link**
   * Make sure there is a `README.md` file in the repo
   * Make sure the `README.md` file contains the changes made (Change Log)

2. **GitHub Pages published URL**
